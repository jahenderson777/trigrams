# HealthUnlocked technical test - trigrams

A trigram is sequence of 3 words in any given text. Let's take an example sentence: "the cat sat on the other cat on the mat on the floor" - its trigram map will look like this:
```clj
{["the" "cat"]   ["sat"]
 ["cat" "sat"]   ["on"]
 ["sat" "on"]    ["the"]
 ["on" "the"]    ["other" "mat" "floor"]
 ["the" "other"] ["cat"]
 ... etc.
 }
 ```

To generate a new sequence of text, start with a key at random, say `["on" "the"]`, and then pick a value at random, say `"other"`, now you have a trigram `["on" "the" "other"]`. For the next trigram, you look up `["the" "other"]` and get a value at random - in this case there will only be one, `"cat"`. Continue ad infinitum.

Using a book of your choosing from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and the process described above, please complete the following:

1. Ignoring punctuation marks, generate a sequence of 50 words.
2. Generate 10 full sentences (sentences start with a capital letter and end in a punctuation mark).
3. Given a word from the text, generate a sentence which contains it anywhere inside it (i.e. not just the start).

Portion reserved for their own purposes, to scare any man cross the moor out of the coroner not finally put an end of it is very well come from someone who has the honour to call him off of that brandy and I answered him rather more clear to you.


Task 2: Generate 10 full sentences
Our arrival had left upon both of us will go back with him all right if you know that he kept his wife had some other man’s gate and declare that a close inspection for the uneasiness of his daughter, but I will tell you, Watson, this time of the returning heir of the most part at Coombe Tracey, but Watson will leave his things as a relief to his ancestral home as he did really believe in such a house as this. My hand upon him for food and so still that dense white sea, with the thornbush upon it? The clearing, and there ran mute behind him such a creature upon the right one, but sooner or later we must come upon the moor, leading me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. Him because you were going to restore the glories of the moor, though, of course, do what he said It might be found among the boulders upon the right of way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down the street and waited with sombre patience for the instant realise that that is no smell which might deliver him over to the interest which the boy had been observed, and that he had been involved appeared to be in a sheer cliff which overlooked a stone-strewn slope. Both these reasons I thought that I could not prove that it was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as he turned round and lunch with us at such short notice. His rooms until nearly three o’clock in the morning, said the postmaster shows that the game may wander. Mud settling, or the fellow may have spoken with me I meant, to be in a grey view of the moor and had dispatched the trap into which one may sink and with the blue coat and the infamous Upwood. Surprised when I was watching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that his wife and not upon the moor, and he appeared to make a greater contrast between brother and I have been able to induce him to further confidences. Drove my anger from my father, who also had a vague vision of Holmes in high glee, rubbing his hands with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on. Anything outside the ordinary routine of life over here.


Task 2: Given a word from the text, generate a sentence which contains it anywhere inside it (using example of 'great')
It might be the heir to great wealth, to that man’s face within the field of my unhappy history you will spare an hour and a little cry of pain from the reverential way in which you wish to have you been on the other side of the next of kin because he shot in his study the upshot of our wheels died away as soon after breakfast I met Mrs.
